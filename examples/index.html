<title>Heading component</title>

<script type="module" src="../src/MoreHtmlHeading-loader.js"></script>
<body style="margin: 0;">
  <h1 is="morehtml-h1" hash="example-page">The Example Page of &lt;h1 is=morehtml-h1&gt; </h1>
  <p>
    Normally there is a lot of text below such an H1, until there is an H2 at some point.
  </p>

  <h2 is="morehtml-h2" hash="sub-headline">A sub headline</h2>
  <p>
    This H2 uses the tag <code>&lt;morehtml-h2&gt;</code> for this specific headline.
  </p>

  <h3 is="morehtml-h3">H3 with ümlauts and alikes ßÜñ</h3>
  <p>
    The special characters should not show up in the hash, since that might
    screw up the URL and to make it simpler, we make URLs contain simple chars/ASCII only.
    In the end they are only hashes on a URL, but supposed to stay kinda a useful.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin: 2rem;" is="morehtml-h4" hash="h4-headline" show-link>
    H4 headline with space on the left of the heading (for the link icon)
  </h4>
  <p>
    Just like the H2, just an H4 :).
  </p>

  <div style="direction: rtl;">
    <h2 is="morehtml-h2" hash="rtl">A RTL H2, let's see how that goes!?</h2>
    <p>and some text below, which should all be right to left, shouldnt it?</p>
  </div>

</body>
