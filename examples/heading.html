  <h1 is="more-h1" id="example-page">The Example Page of &lt;h1 is=more-h1&gt; </h1>
  <p>
    When hovering over the H1 above should show an icon with a link which allows to copy the URL.
  </p>

  <h2 is="more-h2" id="sub-headline">A sub headline</h2>
  <p>
    The link should also appear on an H2.
    Basically this is just <br>
    <code>&lt;h2 is="more-h2"</code>
  </p>

  <h2 is="more-h2" id="complex-headline">
    <a href="#">
      <span>Complex headline markup</span>
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The headline itself should be linked to #,
    the "#" behind it should provide a link with the id as hash at the end.
  </p>

  <a href="#">
    <h2 is="more-h2" id="wrapped-headline">Wrapped Headline in a-href</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
    The headline itself should be linked to #,
    the "#" behind it should provide a link with the id as hash at the end.
  </p>

  <h3 is="more-h3">Headline with missing id attribute</h3>
  <p>
    No link should show up, since the "id" attribute is required and missing here.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin: 2rem;" is="more-h4" id="h4-headline">
    H4 headline with space on the left of the heading.
  </h4>
  <p>
    Just like the H2, just an H4 :).
  </p>

  <div style="direction: rtl;">
    <h2 is="more-h2" id="rtl">A RTL H2, let's see how that goes!?</h2>
    <p>The link should show up on the left of the heading.</p>
  </div>

</body>
