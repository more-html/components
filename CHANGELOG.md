- [ ] Move the `check-todo-list.js` into it's own repo, including the description how and why to use it.
- [ ] Write out some project guidelines (like gold standard, progressive enhancement by default, etc.)
      Every component in this orga can also use a different web component compiling framework/library, in the
      end it has to deliver a web component, no matter if it is with pure JS, stencil, skate, etc.
- [ ] Plan/Write about the core/loader component, which can be loaded for common web-component loading/polyfilling/etc.
      will land in a separate repo some day (might start out being embedded in here)
- [ ] Allow passing in a template which shall be used as the link icon.
- [ ] Use a lib that does special character replacing for hash building.
- [ ] Use hamjest for more explicit error messages.
- [ ] Do the render-when-ready trick, to prevent flickering in case the component changes the rendering.
- [ ] Write proper tests, that ensure it works in the browser as expected (pupeteer?).
- [ ] `<script src="MoreHtmlHeading.js?debug"` When loading with debug show messages like "Missing `id` attribute, no link rendered, etc." 
- [ ] provide senseful properties main, types, module, browser in package.json
